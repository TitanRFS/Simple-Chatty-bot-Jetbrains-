This is code from one of the projects I've worked on through the JetBrains Academy.

Greet: This function greets the user and introduces the chatbot by providing its name and creation date. Then, it asks the user for their name.

RemindName: This function takes a string input for the user's name and prints out a confirmation message that includes the name they inputted.

GuessAge: The chatbot attempts to guess the user's age by asking them to divide their age by 3 different numbers (3, 5, and 7). It then calculates the age based on the user's answers.

Count: This function asks the user to enter a number and then starts a loop that prints out all the numbers starting from 0 until the user's input is reached.

Test: A multiple-choice question is presented to the user. If the user answers correctly, the while loop ends and the function exits. If the user answers incorrectly, a message is printed out that asks the user to enter their choice again.
